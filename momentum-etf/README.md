### 🧠 The Science Behind Momentum

**Academic Research Shows:**
- Momentum strategies have delivered **8-12% annual alpha** globally (Jegadeesh & Titman, 1993)
- **84% of institutional investors** use momentum-based strategies (Goldman Sachs, 2023)
- Indian markets exhibit **stronger momentum effects** than developed markets due to lower efficiency

### ⚡ Our Winning Formula

**Momentum Score Calculation:**
```
Combined Score = (12-month return × 60%) + (3-month return × 40%)
```

**Why This Works:**
- **12-month period (252 days)**: Captures long-term structural trends
- **3-month period (60 days)**: Identifies recent acceleration  
- **60/40 weighting**: Balances stability with responsiveness

**Smart Risk Management:**
- ✅ **Moving Average Filter**: Only invest when ETF > 50-day average
- ✅ **Drawdown Protection**: Skip ETFs down >50% from recent highs
- ✅ **Data Quality Check**: Minimum 200 days of reliable data required
- ✅ **Position Sizing**: Equal weight top 5 ETFs (max 20% each)
- ✅ **Exit Buffer**: Sell when ETF rank falls below 10 (2x portfolio size)
